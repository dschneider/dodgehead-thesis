SHADING
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In computer graphics, Shading refers to the process of altering a color based on its angle to lights and
its distance from lights to create a photorealistic effect. Shading is performed during the rendering process.
Shading alters the colors of faces in a 3D model based on the angle of the surface to the sun or other light sources.
The very first image below has the faces of the box rendered, but all in the same color. Edge lines have been rendered here
as well which makes the image easier to see. The second image is the same model rendered without edge lines. It is 
difficult to tell where one face of the box ends and the next begins. The third image has shading enabled, which makes the 
image more realistic and makes it easier to see which face is which.

SHADING ALGORITHMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Flat shading is a lighting technique used in 3D computer graphics. It shades each polygon of an object based on the angle
between the polygon's surface normal and the direction of the light source, their respective colors and the intensity of
the light source. It was used for high speed rendering where more advanced shading techniques were too computationally
expensive. But by the end of the 20th century affordable graphics cards were offering smooth shading that were also very
fast, making flat shading for speed reasons unnecessary.
The disadvantage of flat shading is that it gives low-polygon models a faceted look. Sometimes this look can be advantage-
ous though, such as in modeling boxy objects; flat shading is only inappropriate when the object must appear with smoother
curves than actually modeled. Artists sometimes use flat shading to look at the polygons of a solid model they are creating.
More advanced and realistic lighting and shading techniques include Gouraud shading and Phong shading.

LIGHT SOURCES
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are many types of lights:

* Ambient Light - An ambient light lights all objects within a scene equally, brightening them without adding shading.
* Directional Light - A directional light illuminates all objects equally from a given direction. It's like an area light of
infinite size and infinite distance from the scene. There is shading, but cannot be any distance falloff.
* Point Light - A point light originates from a single point, and spreads outward in all directions.
* Spotlight - A spotlight originates from a single point, and spreads outward in a coned direction.
* Area Light - An area light originates from a single plane and illuminates all objects in a given direction beginning from that
plane.
* Volume Light - A volume light is an enclosed space lighting objects within that space.

Shading is interpolated based on how the angle of these light sources reach the objects within a scene. Of course, these
light sources can be and often are combined in a scene. The renderer then interpolates how these lights must be combined,
and produces a 2d image to be displayed on the screen accordingly.
