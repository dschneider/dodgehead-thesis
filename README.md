## Evaulation of 3D Game Engines / Evaluierung von 3D Game Engines

### Overview

This project is the result of my Bachelor Thesis at Reutlingen University. It's using the awesome [OGRE3D Engine](http://www.ogre3d.org/) which is also used for games like Torchlight, Venetica, The Book of Unwritten Tails, Jack Keane and many more.

### Goal of the project

The goal was to build a game that assists students in learning Computer Graphics by giving them the opportunity to play around with textures, matrices, vectors and other techniques from the field of CG. Given the short amount of time for the thesis I was only able to create the basis for the project - which is now developed by other students at Reutlingen University.
